## What is this? 

This is a Minesweeper clone with an added twist: it is also a solver! The solving agent uses the current state of the board to determine the probability that each cell in the board is a mine. Equipped with this information, the agent will determine the cell with the smallest probability of being a mine, ideally 0%, and will click that cell; this pattern will continue until the board has been solved or the agent loses. 

## How to Determine the Probabilities?

At any given point during a Minesweeper game, there is at least one valid board combination (configuration of mines in the board adhering to the rules of the game), given the current state of the board. To determine the probability of a cell, $X_1$, being a mine, you take the total number of valid board combinations with $X_1$ as a mine, divided by the total number of valid board combinations. If there are no valid board combinations that have $X_1$ as a mine, then the probability of the $X_1$ being a mine is 0%; however, if every valid board combination has $X_1$ as a mine, then the probability of $X_1$ being a safe cell is 100%. More often than not, there are some board combinations that are valid with $X_1$ being a mine, and there are some board combinations that are valid with $X_1$ being a safe cell; in this case, given the state of the board, the cell is "undecided," as it could be a safe cell or a mine cell. 

## How Does the Algorithm Work? 

Each clicked cell within the board gives you a rule (axiom) that must be true. These rules contain two critical pieces of information, the number of mines around the cell and the names of the surrounding cells. To illustarte this idea, consider the following board configuration, as well as the rules that are generated by this board: 

1AB2C
DEFGH

Rules: 
[1, {'A', 'D', 'E'}]
[2, {'B', 'C', 'F', 'G', 'H'}]

Equipped with these rules, we can determine valid board configurations. We do this by generating mine configurations, and then checking to see if they adhere to every rule that has been generated so far. Although this is the general algorithm we use to determine our probabilities, with no optomizations, the world would freeze over before many expert boards could be solved. If you're interested to see this, you can admire my initial Minesweeper repo, which I created ~2 years ago, with next to no programming or software engineering skills. For example, if we simply generated every valid board configuration for an expert board, before the first click, we would have $C(480, 99) \approx 5.60221 \times 10^{104}$ valid board configurations. You can see that checking if each and every one of these combinations adheres to the generated rules is not a sustainable strategy. 

Solving Minesweeper is an NP-hard problem, resulting in every solution out there ultimately running in exponential time. Although there are various optimizations that can and have been implemented, ultimately, the algorithm will fail to keep up with increasing board sizes. Luckily, the classic board setups are relatively small and can therfore be solved quickly. So, now that we know that optimizations can make this problem solvable given the typical Minesweeper board sizes, what are they?

## Any Future Developments? 

Yes, the main thing that I'd like to add to the solver is a better algorithm for determining which cell the solver chooses, when equipped with the probabilities. Right now, the solver simply clicks the cell that has the lowest probability of being a mine; although this is a very good heuristic, it is not necessarily the optimal choice. You can imagine situations where taking on a bit more risk in the short term results in a higher probability of solving the overall board. As far as implementing this goes, I'm at a bit of a loss; I plan to discuss this problem with some of my professors, and hopefully they can point me in the right direction. If anyone reading this has any ideas, feel free to reach out!
